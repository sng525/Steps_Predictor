1 - in terminal: dotnet workload install maui (Only the first time)
2 - clone repo
3 - Navigate to the Cloned Directory
2 - Create a New .NET MAUI Project:
        .in terminal: dotnet new maui -n MyMauiApp
        .This will create a new .NET MAUI project in a 
        subdirectory called MyMauiApp. If you prefer to 
        create the project directly in the current directory (
        overwriting the existing files), you can omit the 
        -n option: dotnet new maui
        This will overwrite any existing files in the directory, 
        so make sure itâ€™s the desired approach.
